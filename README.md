# Student Industrial Attachment Management System (SIAMS)

Welcome to the **Student Industrial Attachment Management System (SIAMS)**! This project aims to streamline the management and tracking of student industrial attachments for academic institutions, allowing students, supervisors, and institutions to efficiently monitor progress, manage documents, and assess the overall experience.

## üöÄ Project Overview
